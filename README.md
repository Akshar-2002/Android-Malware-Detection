# Android Malware Detection

The objective of the project is to build Machine Learning Models to classify an Android application as an authentic application or a malware.

The dataset, taken from Kaggle, consists of information about 398 applications and 330 Android permissions asked by the application. This information is used to classify it as a malware or not.




## Model Building
Principle Component Analysis Technique was applied to engineer 10 most representative features for the dataset.

For model building, three classification techniques were applied on the engineered dataset:
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Random Forest Classifier
## Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the criteria - Accuracy, Bias, Variance, F1 Score and AUC.

The Learning and ROC Curves for each of the models can be found in Graphs folder.
## Comparision of Models
Model|Accuracy|F1 Score|AUC|Model Behaviour
-----|--------|--------|---|---------------
Logistic Regression|0.89|0.89|0.95|The model exhibits low bias and low variance.
KNN|0.90|0.90|0.90|The model exhibits low bias and medium variance.
Random Forest|0.88|0.88|0.93|The model exhibits very low bias and high variance.

To conclude, there is no significant difference in the Accuracies and the F1-Scores of the three models. 
Considering AUC of ROC and bias & variance, Logistic Regression looks to be a better model among the three.
